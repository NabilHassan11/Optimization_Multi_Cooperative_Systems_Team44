## ðŸ“– Overview
This repository contains the code, simulations, and analysis for optimizing cooperative path planning in **multi-UAV systems**. The goal is to minimize exploration time, maximize coverage efficiency, and ensure collision-free navigation while adhering to constraints (e.g., restricted zones, communication range). Four metaheuristic algorithms are implemented and compared:
1. **Simulated Annealing (SA)**
2. **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
3. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
4. **Teaching-Learning Based Optimization (TLBO)**

---

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Algorithm Implementations**: Code for SA, GA, PSO, and TLBO with customizable parameters.
- **Constraint Handling**: Avoid restricted zones, maintain safe inter-UAV distances, and enforce velocity/angle limits.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Plot UAV paths, convergence curves, and fitness metrics.
- **Performance Comparison**: Standard deviation, mean fitness, and best fitness across 15 runs.
